### Academic bio

I earned my Master's degree in the [Cognitive & Information Sciences](https://cogsci.ucmerced.edu) program at UC Merced, where I contributed to research in Dr. Zenaida Aguirre-Muñoz's [Language,Learning, and Teaching Lab](https://www.languagelearningandteachinglab.org/). I am currently a PhD student in the same program.

My research interests focus on how digital technologies can support language learning, with particular attention to reading comprehension, attentional processes, and metacognitive monitoring during reading. I am especially interested in how innovative tools, such as AI-powered reading assistants, can be designed and integrated into classroom settings to support readers’ regulation of attention, comprehension strategies, and self-monitoring. My work places a strong emphasis on bilingual contexts, examining how technology-mediated support can enhance language acquisition and reading comprehension for multilingual learners.
